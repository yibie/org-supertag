;;; org-supertag/ops/relation.el --- Relation operations for Org-Supertag -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This file provides standardized operations for Relation entities in the
;; Org-Supertag data-centric architecture. All operations leverage
;; the core transform mechanism and adhere to the defined schema.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'supertag-core-store)
(require 'supertag-core-schema)
(require 'supertag-core-transform)
