* [3.0.5] - 2025-06-25
** Features
*** Decouple metadata and adopt a database-first architecture
- Fields are no longer synchronized with the Org :PROPERTIES: drawer. All field data is now read from and written directly to the database.
- Support for headline :TAGS: has been completely removed. The system now exclusively uses org-supertag's inline-tag format for visual representation in files, while the actual tag relationships are managed solely by the database.
- This view is now the central and sole interface for viewing and editing all metadata associated with a node. Users can modify field values directly within this view, creating a closed loop for data manipulation.
- The :tag field type has been significantly upgraded to natively support one or more tag values (e.g., a movie with multiple directors). The UI accepts comma-separated input and formats the display cleanly (e.g., TagA / TagB / TagC).

** Refactor
**** Change field type tag-reference to direct node reference

BREAKING CHANGE: Completely redesign the tag-reference field type to 
reference nodes directly instead of referencing other tag's field values.

Before:
- tag-reference pointed to another tag's field value
- Used for value inheritance between different tags

After:
- tag-reference now directly points to org nodes
