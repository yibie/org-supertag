;;; supertag-ops-embed.el --- Embed operations for org-supertag -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This module provides embed-related operations for the org-supertag system.
;; It handles finding embed blocks by source files and other embed operations.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

(defun supertag-ops-embed-find-by-source-file (source-file)
  "Find all embed blocks that reference nodes from SOURCE-FILE.
Returns a list of source-ids (node IDs) that have embed blocks referencing them."
  (let ((source-ids '()))
    ;; This is a simplified implementation
    ;; In a full implementation, this would search through all embed databases
    ;; to find which nodes from source-file are embedded elsewhere
    (when (and source-file (file-exists-p source-file))
      ;; For now, return an empty list
      ;; TODO: Implement proper lookup in embed sync database
      source-ids)))
